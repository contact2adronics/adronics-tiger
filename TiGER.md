# Introduction #

If you are hobbyist or student then ATMega microcontroller is best option for your project. Not because of its architecture but because of availability of tools and programmer. There are many free tools (Programmer, compiler etc) for Atmel microcontroller. If you are using Atmel ATMega series microcontroller and don’t want to spend time in designing PCB and soldering then TiGER board is best option for you. If you want to assemble your own PCB- You can buy TiGER PCB and solder its component.

The TiGER is an open platform for Atmel ATMEGA series microcontroller – What is an open platform?

All documents, schematic and source code will be available free to users. In fact you can develop your own library, project code and share it. Also you can modify existing source code as per your project requirement.

This project, hosted on code.google.com (http://code.google.com/p/adronics-tiger/), is meant to address the needs of TiGER users needing a reference starting point. Bugs on the website, board, and reference software are tracked here, as well as proving all of the reference/diagnostic software.
