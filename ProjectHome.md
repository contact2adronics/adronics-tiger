The TiGER is a open platform for Atmel ATMEGA series microcontroller.

This project, hosted on code.google.com, is meant to address the needs of TiGER users needing a reference starting point. Bugs on the website, board, and reference software are tracked here, as well as proving all of the reference/diagnostic software.
